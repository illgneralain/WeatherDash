# User Story

As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly

# Solutions

When i call the openweather API 
I will retrieve the weather data for cities 
and be able to know the weather before traveling to plan a more efficient trip with no surprises 

# Issues 

Successfully calling the API so lets functions were required. I followed tutorial video found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-gMLzlG_ME  but i guess with lack of time and preparation and my 
group being behind in work, was unable to successfulyly see this through

My assignment is already late so as I could figure this out
I just don't have the time
